GIT
Git is a version control system.
Git helps you keep track of code changes  IN THE SOURCE CODE.
Git is used to collaborate on code.
it donesn't store differences,it stores links to snapshot of changed files in case file wasn't changed
if the fole not changed ,it stores just a link to the previous identical files that was already stored.so each time you can make changes,it takes a picture of what all files look like at the moment and stores a reference to that snapshot
